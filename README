== BrowserizedStyles ==

Browserized Styles provides a dead simple way to create browser and operating sytem-specific 
CSS code for use in a Rails application. All you need to do is create a .css file targeted to
a browser by appending an underscore and identifiers to the end.

=== Installation ===

script/plugin install http://svn.intridea.com/svn/public/browserized_styles

=== Example ===

Let's say I have some complex CSS code that looks bad in some browsers, but works in
others. Let's also say that i've put it into a stylesheet in stylesheets/complex.css.

My stylesheet link tag looks something like this:

<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'complex' %>

Now all I have to do to target a browser is create a new CSS file with the browser's
identifier appended to it with an underscore (e.g. "complex_ie6.css"). That's it!
The same exact stylesheet link tag will automatically check the current user
agent and load a browser-specific CSS file if it exists. Ta-da! One-step browser
styles!

=== Identifiers ===

Browsers and OS's are identified as following. You would create the CSS file as 
"yourcssfile_browsername.css" or "yourcssfile_osname" or "yourcssfile_browsername_osname"

==== Browsers ====

IE6:       ie6
IE7:       ie7
Opera:     opera
Firefox:   gecko
Safari:    safari
Konqueror: konqueror

==== Operating Systems ====

Mac OS (X or prior): mac
Windows (any): win
Linux: linux

=== Limitations and Caveats ===

At this time the plugin is only designed to work with .css files in your stylesheets 
directory. It will not work at present with URL-based stylesheets or stylesheets not
found in your stylesheets directory (or some subdirectory thereof).

At the moment, stylesheets are included in this order: original, browser-specific, 
os-specific, browser-and-os-specific. This is logically from least to most specific,
but if you need a different order you will have to hack it manually.
